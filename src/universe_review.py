"""AI review of the trading universe: what to drop, what to consider adding.

Two powers, deliberately unequal.

**Veto** (applied automatically). The model may block *new buys* of a symbol
already in the universe. It may never sell, never buy, and never raise more
than ``max_vetoes`` of them in one run. A veto is only accepted for a
structural fact about the security - a delisting, a merger, a ticker change, a
trading halt, an accounting investigation - never for an opinion about price,
valuation or prospects. Ranking by prospects is the strategy's job, and the
strategy can be backtested; this cannot.

**Proposal** (never applied). The model may suggest symbols *outside* the
universe worth a human look. These are written to the report and to storage
and go no further. Adding a name to the universe stays a human edit of
config.yaml.

The asymmetry is the whole design. A wrong veto costs one missed opportunity
in one name for a few days. A wrong buy costs money, and a universe the model
quietly rewrites is a strategy no backtest describes - which is exactly the
failure the 2026-08-27 backtest was run to avoid. So the power that can only
subtract is automatic, and the power that adds is advisory.

Every veto must cite evidence from the headlines it was given. One with an
empty citation is dropped before it reaches storage: a model that cannot say
why is a model that is guessing.

Produce two lists.

1. "vetoes" - universe members whose NEW PURCHASES should be paused because of
   a structural fact about the security itself. Allowed categories only:
   {", ".join(VETO_CATEGORIES)}.
   A veto is NOT for: a weak quarter, a high valuation, a downgrade, a falling
   price, a sector you dislike, or any forecast. If today's headlines give you
   no such structural fact, return an EMPTY list - that is the normal answer
   on almost every day, and an empty list is a better answer than a stretched
   one. Every veto must quote the specific headline it rests on in
   "evidence". No headline, no veto. At most {self.max_vetoes}.

2. "candidates" - up to {self.max_candidates} liquid, large-cap US-listed
   symbols NOT already in the universe that a human might reasonably consider
   adding, with a one-sentence reason. These are suggestions for a person to
   review; nothing is bought from this list. Prefer names that widen sector
   coverage over more of what the universe already holds. No leveraged,
   inverse, single-stock or otherwise exotic ETFs. Return an empty list if
   nothing stands out.

Write "reason" in Korean. Symbols must be plain tickers, uppercase.
